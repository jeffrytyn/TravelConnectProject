# TravelConnectProject
A personal learning project for Node.js, Express, user auth, etc. A small social media site.


Future changes:
* increase performance with MongoDB indexes
* store posts with author instead of having PostSchema (could run faster as number of posts increase?)
* file uploads for images
* delete post confirmation
* deleting user account and all associated posts/following users
* different auth methods
* search bar scroll move with up/down arrow
* submit search bar form on enter key
